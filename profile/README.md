## Welcome to BINGO's Repository. 👋

BINGO is a project that aims to develop a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system that can decode imagined speech (speech that is thought but not spoken). To do this, the project will use cutting-edge machine learning techniques and a carefully designed experimental protocol. The project will also investigate the potential of imagined speech as an intuitive paradigm and will explore the possibility of expanding the vocabulary of imagined speech that can be decoded. In addition, the project will release a publicly available benchmarking framework to facilitate the comparison and validation of computational methods for imagined speech decoding.
